```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

2 - Update `.env`, `devcontainer.json` and `docker-compose.yml` file with your own configuration.  
Be careful with the names you give, they must be the same from one file to another.
ðŸ’¡ Use the find and replace function of your editor.

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

3 - Create an alias for the sail command

```shell
alias sail='sh $([ -f sail ] && echo sail || echo vendor/bin/sail)'
```

4 - Run Docker

```shell
sail up -d 
```

5 - Install project's dependencies

```shell
sail composer install
```

If generate user interface from the back-end and need hot reload during devlopmment : 

```shell
sail npm install
```

6 - Run Migration

```shell
sail artisan migrate
```

7 - Open a browser and if you didn't change this ports :   
-  see your application at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/)  
-  see your pgAdmin GUI at [http://localhost:5055/browser](http://localhost:5055/browser)
